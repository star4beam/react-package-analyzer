# Test Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the test project and how to work with it.

## Running the Analysis

The test project is already configured to be analyzed by the `react-package-analyzer`. The configuration is in the `react-import-analyzer.config.js` file in this directory.

To run the analysis and generate the reports, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
npx react-package-analyzer --config test-project/react-import-analyzer.config.js
```

The reports will be generated in the `../test-project-import-analysis` directory.
